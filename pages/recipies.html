            <div class="box">
              " Espresso is a highly concentrated coffee known for its intense
              flavor and thick, syrupy body, created by pushing nearly boiling
              water through finely-ground coffee at around 9 bars of pressure.
              The result is a small, potent shot with a complex taste that can
              be sweet, bitter, or even fruity, depending on the beans used and
              the brewing technique. Espresso has a characteristic "crema"—a
              golden, creamy foam that forms on top due to the pressure,
              capturing oils and aromas from the coffee beans. Unlike drip
              coffee, espresso is made quickly, in about 20–30 seconds, and is
              both consumed on its own and used as a foundation for many classic
              coffee drinks !! "

              " An Americano is a popular espresso-based coffee that combines
              one or two shots of espresso with hot water, creating a drink
              that's similar in strength to drip coffee but with a distinctively
              rich, smooth taste. This method preserves the bold, slightly
              caramelized flavor of espresso while mellowing its intensity and
              bitterness with the addition of water. The Americano originated
              during World War II, when American soldiers in Europe would dilute
              espresso with hot water to make it resemble the coffee they were
              used to back home. Today, it’s enjoyed for its versatility: you
              can control the strength by adjusting the espresso-to-water ratio,
